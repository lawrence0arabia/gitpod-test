This is an example program to test your SplashKit installation!

Steps to run the program:

1) Open a terminal window
    - Click the hamburger menu in the top left
    - Open the "Terminal" menu
    - Click "New Terminal"
    Alternatively, use control + shift + ` (this is called a backtick by the way!)

2) Compile program.cpp
    - Enter the command:
        skm clang++ program.cpp -o program
        Where "program.cpp" is the source code and "program" is the name of the output file (it doesn't have to be program)
    (If you get the error "no such file or directory", make sure you are in the correct directory. You can change directories in the terminal with the command "cd [directory name]", and use "cd ../" to go back one directory)

3) Run program
    - Enter the command:
        ./program

The program should run. It'll ask you for your name and your quest.
Try modifying the program, SplashKit is quite powerful, so there are a lot of things you can do with it!
Remember to save and re-compile the file whenever you modify it, or your changes won't appear.
Have a look at the splashkit documentation at splashkit.io for inspiration! 

(At this point the browser version of SplashKit does not support graphical output, so your programs must run in the terminal)
